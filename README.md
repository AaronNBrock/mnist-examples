# MNIST-examples
A few examples of Machine Learning using the MNIST dataset.

## Setup

1. Install [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/)
2. Create tensorflow v1 environment
```bash
conda env create -f environment-tf1.yml
```
3. Activate the environment
```bash
conda activate tensorflow-v1
```
4. Start Jupyter Notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
5. Open open up the notebook of choice (start with `MNIST-Simple.ipynb`).

Note:  You may be get a warning along the lines of "Kernal not found, select kernal." if so, just select `tensorflow-v1` from the dropdown.  (or, navigate to `Kernal` > `Change kernal` > `Python [conda env:tensorflow-v1`)
